## 🩺 Health Diseases Prediction System

### 🔍 Overview
The **Health Diseases Prediction System** is a machine learning-based web application designed to assist users in identifying potential health issues such as **diabetes, Parkinsons disease, heart disease**based on key medical inputs. Built using Python and Streamlit, the system leverages well-structured datasets to provide accurate and fast predictions that can support early diagnosis and awareness.
